    "## Data modification\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the documentation will investigate how precise filters can prevent HOG and SVM from detecting faces successfully. HOG and SVM was chosen because we currently determine the keypoints of the faces with this approach. The images, which were used during this section, stem from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The dataset contains more than 13,000 images of 5,749 people. However, we focused exclusively on individuals for whom a minimum of 100 facial images were available, leading to 1140 final images. Without any modifications, the algorithm detects 1099/1140 faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cow Face Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the Cow Face Filter is that it falsifies the magnitude and direction of the gradient vectors in the face, which HOG uses to extract features. The pattern has strong intensity changes (black and white) that will create gradient vectors with a significantly bigger magnitude than the vectors of the original face. We used different alpha values for the pattern, to see how it affects the detection. An example with an alpha value of 45 can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cow Mask with Alpha of 45](images/CowMaskwithAlphaof45.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with different alpha values yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cow Mask Modification](images/CowMaskModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach does work for preventing face detection, although it also significantly alters the facial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Salt and Pepper Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Salt and Pepper Filter, which has an additional alpha value for the transparency of the salt and pepper pattern, was based on the same idea as the Cow Face Filter. An example with an alpha value of 45 can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salt and Pepper with Alpha of 45](images/SaltandPepperwithalphaof45.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with different alpha values yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salt and Pepper Modification](images/SaltandPepperModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the salt and pepper is very similar to the cow pattern, the resulting diagram is almost identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pixelate\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pixelate filter pixelates the image. On the website, it can be applied only to the face or to the entire image. Since the LFW dataset only contains faces, the filter was applied to the entire image. An example with a pixel size of 2 can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pixelate with pixel size of 2](images/Pixelate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with different pixel size values yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pixelate Modification](images/PixelateModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For low pixel size values, the number of detected faces is high and the face is still recognizable. With increasing pixel size values, the face is barely recognizable and the number of detected faces is declining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blur\n",
    "\n",
    "The Blur Filter applies a box blur effect to the image. Similarly to the Pixelate filter, it can be applied only to the face or to the entire image. Since the LFW dataset only contains faces, the filter was applied to the entire image. An example with a radius of 1 can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Box Blur with radius of 1](images/BoxBlur.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with a radius of 1 yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Box Blur Modification](images/BoxBlurModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm still detects 1090/1140 faces after the modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sunglasses\n",
    "\n",
    "A more artistic approach, is the application of sunglasses on the eyes of a given face:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Apply Sunglasses](images/SunglassesonFace.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with different alpha values yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Apply Sunglasses on Face](images/SunglassesonFaceModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this approach does not nearly cover enough area of the face and is rather artistic, the result is not surprising to us. 1000 of the 1140 faces were successfully discovered after the modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Face Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "Another artistic approach is the application of a face mask:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Medicine Mask Example](images/MedicineMaskExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the LFW dataset with different alpha values yields the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Medicine Mask Example](images/MedicineMaskModification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach covers more area of the face. It leads to a considerable change (120 out of 1140 were detected) in comparison to the Sunglasses approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hiding Faces\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this approach is to add additional artifacts to the image, that should erroneously be classified as face by classifiers. An example would be adding face masks to the image and making them barely visible with a low alpha value:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hide with Mask Example](images/HideWithMaskExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach only slightly modifies the face (for low alpha values), and it increases the false positives of the classifiers."
